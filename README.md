# Hiragana Seito Defense - Work in Progress
A typing game designed to help players identify and type Japanese hiragana letters using an English keyboard.  

## WebGL Build (Play in Browser)
https://ben842002.github.io/hiragana-seito-defense/  

Game was originally supposed to be played on an application window so functionalities such as Settings and Quit will not work in the WebGL build.

## Roadmap
1. JSON save and loading
2. Different Difficulty - Time is sped up and slowed down
3. Shop System - Tokens are used to buy various buffs and items
